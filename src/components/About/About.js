                    Hello! Iâ€™m Do Dinh Nhat, a 4th-year student at Ho Chi Minh City Open University, majoring in
                    Information Technology. I am currently seeking an internship opportunity to apply theoretical
                    knowledge to practical situations and develop skills in a professional working environment. With a
                    understanding of the software development process, I have gained experience through various personal
                    and group projects throughout my studies. I am passionate about user interface development and
                    always strive to create high-quality products. I am eager to learn, open to challenges, and believe
                    that an internship will enhance my skills and understanding of the technology industry, while
                    contributing to the success of the team.
                </p>
